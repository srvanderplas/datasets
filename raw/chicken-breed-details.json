{"breeds":[{"name":["Austra White Chicken"],"description":["Our Austra Whites are a cross between one of our best Cackle HatcheryÂ® production/bloodlines of Black Australorp rooster and one of our best Cackle HatcheryÂ® production/bloodlines of White Leghorn hens (parent stock). They were first developed in the early 1900âs. This cross produces offspring that are very good layers throughout the year and lay a very light brown to off white egg shell color egg. The Austra White pullet will be white with little black specks in some feathers. This cross is considered to be a heavier breed and their disposition is calmer than the pure Leghorn chicken breed. There are many benefits to raising baby chickens from this cross. These hens will lay a lot of large eggs; have good feed to egg production ratios and good for chickens for backyards. Raising chickens for eggs at home can be fun and relaxing. Free range chicken eggs are great tasting eggs and this hybrid chicken breed has good reflexes for predator avoidance, however, they are white and easily seen.\nWe also offer at limited times of the year Austra White Fertile Hatching Eggs"],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":": Not applicable","Weights":"Â Henââ5 lbs\nRoosterââ6 1/2 lbs\nPulletâ4 1/2 lbs\nCockerelâ-5 1/2 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Primary production, Egg Laying & Pet/Secondary meat source","Egg Shell Color":"Very light brown to off white egg shell color","Egg Production":"Â Â 220-280 eggs per year (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Â Large","Temperament":"Â Active","Gender Accuracy":"Â 80-85%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","Broody":"Non Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 12 Females to 1 Males","Roost Height":"Â 4 to 8 feet","Country of Origin":"Â Hybrid","APA":"Â No","TLC":"Â No","BREEDER FARM SOURCE":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding Farm has been developing our bloodline or strain of Austra White since 1939."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnKRESJcpuY"],"reviews":[{"id":"364845","rating":"5","author":"Andrea ","date":"2020-07-17T16:18:08-05:00","title":"Very good","review":"Very happy to see my 25 hens get here on time.

The breed was first described by Dutch colonial settlers and first imported to Europe in 1998 by Dutch breeder Jan Steverink. Their beak and tongue, comb and wattles, even their meat bones and organs appear black. The blood of the Ayam Cemani is normally colored. The birdâs black color occurs as a result of excess pigmentation of the tissues, caused by a genetic condition known as fibro melanosis. This gene is also found in some other black fowl breeds. Roosters can get some mulberry upon maturity due to testosterone and other influences. The hens lay cream-colored eggs, although they are poor setters and rarely hatch their own brood.

We have done static (the cooking, rockets, sewing, etc) exhibits before and last year we took 3 meat goats, but we had to keep them a t a friends house for 2 months prior to fair.  Last year se moved to a rental house 1 week before fair and didnât get our statics turned in.  So this year, now that we have a few acres we got a little carried away and took 38 statics   between 3 kids, and we took 3 dairy goats, 5 meat goats, 3 sheep, 6 chickens and 1 rabbit. Whoo!  that was probably a bit much!  We had a great time and the kids received 100 ribbons, plaques and awards in 4-H and our family got another 15 in open class.  We tried a lot of new things and the kids were pleased that for our first year in poultry they got either champion or reserve in showmanship.  We found out we donât like sheep, and we like the chickens more than we thought we would.  We love 4-H and will be incorporating 4-H projects into our homeschool so that most of the projects are done by June and we donât have the summer scramble to finish and then we can just concentrate on the livestock."}]},{"name":["Barred Cochin Standard Chicken"],"description":["When it comes to rare breed chickens, the professionals at Cackle HatcheryÂ® have a lot to offer.

This is one of the color varieties of the Plymouth Rock chicken family and an excellent winter/summer brown egg layer. The Barred Standard Plymouth Rock Chicken is a great back yard poultry for production and very kid friendly chicken. Most people call these âBarred Rocksâ which is a short name for the Barred Plymouth Rock chicken. Some people confuse the Barred Rock chicken with the Dominique chicken breed. The Barred Rock has a single comb (straight comb) and has more of a straight pattern in the barred feathers.

The roosters are quite handsome fellows that are very vocal.  They are protective and will act somewhat aggressive towards me when I am in the coop area.  Still yet, they allow me to pick them up and pet them without any retaliation or attempt to attack me.  The hens are super sweet and will seek me out and even light on my back or shoulders to get attention and love to be held and petted.  I may end up trying some of these out as a dual purposed bird in the future but for now (four months old) they could use some more filling out before I would feel comfortable harvesting one for meat.

I have had chickens for two years and I could not be happier with them. Their feathers shine and their eggs are the best I have ever had. My hens have helped me in more ways than one. You see, it is my ambition to own my own farm one day, so all experience helps. Not to mention their charming personalities. For example, my Barred Rock, Violet is a little silly and my RIR Raspberry is very smart for a chicken, My hens are one of my personal joys.\nI started getting chickensi in May of 2014, after doing a paper on them for learning purposes. Originally I planned on getting chicks simply to earn money, but as soon as I saw them I was immediately in love. The small fluffy bodies and cheeps are impossible to resist. I renew my flock every year in the spring, typically this is because a fox has recently gotten at my girls. However in a way this is good because I have had many different breeds. I was introduced to chickens by one of my parentâs colleagues and have had them ever since.\nThank you again for my gorgeous girls. Also it would be amazing if you could breed a duck, chicken combo. A bird that could lay eggs and swim, this would be useful because than you could own a pool and just leave it open in the summer instead of spending a lot of time creating shade, or even installing air conditioning to your coop. Finally thank you.

I wanted chickens that would produce big brown eggs even in the winter, who were full sized and heavy bodied, who were tough enough to survive long cold winters and who were good mothers. I ordered 10 pullets and 10 cockerels of the Barred Rock breed from you last spring. All lived, including the extra bird, in spite of the snowstorm we had a few days prior to their arrival. On Labor Day weekend we slaughtered all but two roosters and eight hens and kept the rest for egg layers for our own table and to breed more this spring. The meat was wonderful; yellow-skinned and full of flavor. We dined on them all winter. But let me tell you about the eggs! All winter long the girls have been laying their BIG brown eggs, even when the temps dropped to -47 with the wind chill for three days. We kept their coop at 35 degrees and they didnât care â as long as they have food and water they are laying. On sunny days â even with a foot of snow on the ground â they demand to be let out. We had to start selling eggs; they lay 5-9 a day in the winter. There are three other chicken coops in our small area â but none of them produce in the winter, and none lay the big brown eggs. In less than six months your fine breeding and excellent breed descriptions have made me locally popular for being reliable producer of quality eggs. Thanks â such was not my intent, but I canât eat all of these eggs!"},{"id":"170549","author":"Doug, Oklahoma March 2012 ","date":"2015-12-02T21:19:02-05:00","title":"Cackle Customer Feedback","review":"I would like to tell you thank you very much for the healthy chicks.

They are doing quite well, one or two of the chicks has a soft poop but still seem to be full of energy. Being I never experienced chicks before, I was really surprised at how fast they grow. On the fifth day I had to extend my wall of the brooding area because they would jump and or fly over my twelve inch high pen. I did lose one of the barred rocks around the third or fourth day. I actually expected to lose two or three but I am blessed to have lost only one.

Our chicks have been nothing short of SPLENDID from you, always arriving warm, dry and healthy. Our customers have been very pleased with their chicks, some even bring me photos of last yearâs chickens, boasting about their egg production and health of their flock. We have enjoyed many repeat customers based on the over-all happiness of the chicks, that although come from our store YOU are the ones that deserve the accolades. Our store is the smallest in our chain but we have never been treated as if we were not as important as other stores with larger orders by your staff. Just this last Monday I called needing to put in an âEmergencyâ order as we quickly ran out of chicks that had just arrived 3 days earlier. I had to have new chicks in the store no later than Friday. I was wonderfully taken care of and sent via the phone to someone that could help me out in your âover-hatchâ. One hundred more chicks were not only ordered but shipped that day to my store. They arrived this morning right on time and in excellent health. i have had chickens all my life, dealt with many hatcheries but I can say without a doubt I have been most impressed by your customer service and quality of chicks.

This year has been so much better that we have just placed 2 more orders. Your chicks are top quality and the customer service is awesome. Each time we have spoken with customer service they have been polite, knowledgeable and have plenty of time to educate us and help us. They never pushed anything on us or rushed us. I would like to give special acknowledgement to Bettina. She was our rep for the 2 orders placed today. She surpassed all our expectations today. Which is saying quite a lot since Cackle Hatchery has set the bar so high till now anyway. She is a true asset to your company. She even took the time to help us identify our âmysteryâ chicken.

It was created by Gerd Roth in the 1970âs using Amrocks (Barred Rocks), Malines, Rhode Island Reds and New Hampshire. It has gained the term the âUber Chickenâ due to itâs many desirable characteristics such as being a dual purpose bird and a auto-sexing breed. Male and female chicks look different directly after hatching which makes sexing the birds extremely easy. This breed are a prolific layer on large to extra large eggs.

And also generally the most winning variety at poultry shows.Â They have what the judges are looking for and also what many poultry enthusiasts want in a backyard chicken.\nOur seedstock for the large fowl black Ameraucana came from their creator, John W Blehm of Michigan, in 2014. Cackle HatcheryÂ® breeds them to produce the bluest egg shells possible â the natural light pastel blue color. A small percentage, however, may be light green shades. For a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nNewbie Note: Some white feathers appear in the first and second stage feathering, which is normal. But by the sixth month the black Ameraucana chicken will have solid black feathers.\nPlease note that this breed has an inherent genetic beak issue. One out of 100 chicks, as they grow, may have some variance in severity of scissor beak/cross beak. The best description for this condition is that the top and bottom beak do not align. And the condition normally will get worse as they grow. Numerous articles are on the internet. And you can find more information in our Cackle Hatchery blog.\nNOTE: Our sexers have a hard time determining the gender of the Ameraucana. As a result, their vent sexing on this breed is about 80% accurate on the average. Thatâs well below the normal average of 90% accurate on other breeds. Please take this into consideration when ordering females.

They are calm around people and predator resistant. At feeding time, my kids can walk up to these hens and pick them up. We had a dog in the yard chase our chickens this past fall. He caught our heavy chickens, but all of our phoenix (15) were up in the trees and on top of our neighbors house 500 ft away! They are broody in their first year,  and lay a surprising amount of eggs. As ours came into lay, they started the same time as red sex links. They respond well to lights in the winter, and are required if you want egg production to stay high in the fall. The eggs are smaller, and the hens will hide nests if they free range. About half of the roosters will grow long beautiful tails. They need more space that is  out of mud and ice, otherwise their tails will break from dragging feathers on the ground.  These are the best phoenix that I have seen that came from a hatchery. If youâre looking for an exotic chicken that lays well, these are it!

This is an interesting poultry breed that first arrived in the country around 1845. The name actually refers to the fact that the bird is a Chinese Shanghai Fowl, and there are many reasons why you may want to have some on your property. Not only do they get along well with children, but they are great for raising chicks. These chickens lay small to medium sized brown eggs and this variety is notable for its dark black coloring. We added some new bloodline from Roland Doerr to our flocks in 2009 to do some improvements to their size.

A good heavy breed but slower to grow than some breeds before surpassing them in weight and size. They are slow to mature and have a poor feed/weight conversion, which explains why they arenât popular as a commercial broiler, although they were popular in the late 1800âs for chickens for meat. It is the largest of the dual purpose chicken and eventually excels as a meat chicken and a fairly good laying hen. When grown the black feathers take on a green sheen within the black color. These chickens were admitted to the American Standard of Perfection in 1922 and both varieties (whites and blacks) are noted for willow colored or nearly black legs and toes. We offer this chicken breed in a production line and not a show line.\nThe males will grow to 11-14 pounds in weight with the Cackle Hatchery blood line..\nNewbie notes: There are some white feathers in their 1st and 2nd stage feathering which is normal but by the 6th month they are solid black feathers.\nWe also offer at limited times of the year Black Jersey Giant Fertile Hatching Eggs"],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":"Â American Class","Weights":"Â Henâ-10 lbs Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Roosterââ13 lbs\nPulletâ-8 lbsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cockerelââ11 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Primary production, Egg Laying & Pet/Secondary meat source","Egg Shell Color":"Â Brown","Egg Production":"Â 180-260 eggs per year (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Medium","Temperament":"Â Docile","Gender Accuracy":"Â 80-85%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 9 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 2 to 4 feet","Country of Origin":"Â United States, New Jersey","APAÂ":"APA:Â Yes, Recognized by the Standard of Perfection in 1922","ALBCÂ":"ALBC:Â Watch Status, Considered a sustainable heritage chicken breed.","Breeder Farm Source":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding Farm has been developing our bloodline/strain of production typeÂ (non exhibition type) Black Jersey Giant since 1979."}],"availability":{},"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/037FEeDNXx0","https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9qeXy6o3F4"],"reviews":[{"id":"364768","rating":"5","author":"Michael ","date":"2020-06-18T16:48:52-05:00","title":"Happiness!","review":"We ordered the first time from Cackle this year.

All of the birds arrived alive which is amazing since we are located in hawaii! I would like to point out that they give you a full list of what you ordered/ got extra which was a really nice touch. We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue. I would like to mention we ordered 10 roos that were all marked on their heads with paint which was amazing. Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle.

The loss was horrendous, and compounded by the fact that they were hatched by my youngest daughterâs first grade class.  We sat down as a family, and the seven of us narrowed it down to four breeds for a new batch of chickens.  3 Black Jersey Giants Females and 2 Males, 3 Black Laced Golden Wyandottes F , 3 Dominiques F, and 6 Easter Eggers F.  We have an existing adult flock of 10 mixxed Isa Browns, White Leghorn, and Easter Eggers, all Female.  We ordered two days before a hatch date.  We received our chicks two days later delivered to our door, after they got kicked out of the post office for being too loud. 23 chicks in wonderful shape; an extra male Giant, 2 extra female giants, 1 extra female Wyandotte, and 2 extra Easter Egger females.  We dipped little beaks in water and its been balls full out since then.  100% survival at 6 days old!!!  Perfect total flock ratio of 3 males and 30 females(Barring any surprise roosters). My kids are happy, my wife is happy, and I am very happy.  If every online purchase was this satisfying I might never go to another brick and mortar store again.

The experience has been great. I ordered 8 female black laced Wyandottes and received an order confirmation soon after. I was quickly updated with a follow up email telling me when my chicks would be available to ship and what to expect. They were supposed to ship Monday. It was Monday afternoon, and I am impatiently waiting for the next email for tracking information. I thought maybe they just didnât send it, and called. Customer service was great, prompt answer, briefly placed on hold, and the representative came back and reassured me that they havenât left yet, but they will today and as soon as they are scanned in I will get an email, and everything went just as she said. I called my local post office and gave them a heads up that chicks were coming, and left my numbers just in case. I signed up for USPS text alerts on the package and was concerned that the tracking info said it was going to be delivered Thursday, but they arrived as the hatchery said they would today! (Wednesday). I listened to peeps the entire way home, and was thrilled to open my box with 9 enthusiastic chicks hopping around. All are eating, drinking, and doing well. Would definitely recommend and will someday be making another purchase. Itâs been a great experience.

I ordered 6 female chicks, they added one extra chick to ensure their live delivery guarantee, I was very nervous having read reviews regarding ordering live chicks in the mail. I tracked their shipment constantly, I was nervous when they stayed 24 hours in a hub in MO, but they arrived in two days exactly. When I got the call that they had arrived at my local post office, again I was nervous. I arrived and was handed a chirping box of babies, I cautiously opened them up and found SEVEN live chicks very healthy and robust waiting to get home! Once they got to their brooder, we followed the directions and dipped their beaks in the water and they all took to the waterer in gangbuster form! Now, a week later, all seven are growing, happy and show no signs of problems.

These awesome bantams are all black, except for their turquoise earlobes and dark purple combs and wattles. If you raise other chicken breeds that donât brood, Silkie hens are consistently eager to hatch and raise chicks of any breed.\nYou donât have to choose just one of the five Cackle HatcheryÂ® Silkie varieties.

Wonderful experience- we got several of this breed in our order, got 1 rooster (which is perfect & usually doesnât statistically happen), as a poult he began to grow so strikingly beautiful & his âcrowâ call so uniquely different from our spitzhaubens & polish. We were expecting his feathers to be all black with the green iridescence in most peoples pictures, he ended up growing two super bright red feather markings on his back above his flanks- they look like some type of beast slashed him with a clawed hand (we of course made absolute certain he wasnât injured multiple times, the unique feathers look like a realistic theater makeup job of stereotypical image of a claw slash marks).. If you asked a little boy to draw the coolest looking rooster he could think of, this bird would be the imaginative drawing. He looks so stealthy & regal, like an all-black sports car with detailing that flashes bright shines of green in the blackness, like beetle wings.  They all make noises sometimes which sound like you would hear coming from a loon on a lake somewhere up north or a native flute, whereas other chickens make mainly various clucks.  The sumatras we got, personality-wise, are not overtly cuddly like a puppy but they behave well, were raised appropriately so they handle as good as any other chicken, you should give them the most amount of space that you can offer them in your shelter structure, run, &/or enclosure. (as for any bird- do not crowd, but thatâs especially important for the more intelligent/natural breeds like Sumatras). Their beaks & talons being darker colored do not make it any harder to trim for anyone experienced in bird well-being maintenance. We tell some of our Sumatra hens apart by subtle color differences on their feet & claws, some hens have bright yellow markings on their palms, or a couple certain light colored claws among otherwise dark ones. Overall highly satisfied with our order."},{"id":"325882","rating":"5","author":"Beautiful Roo and 2 Hens ","date":"2019-11-21T14:20:46-05:00","title":"Absolutely love my Black Sumatraâs","review":"All my chicks arrived perfect in their little cozy shopping container.

They have a nice typical crow, and are good foragers. Not great egg layers but these are awesome birds. Mature roosters will get a somewhat red rose combe but it is small.

They are not the same as Easter Eggerâ¢. Nor are they Araucana. They are the real deal!Â  We have a limited supply of this rare variety, created by Master Breeder John W. Blehm.\nFor a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nBlue chickens are based on blacks, but with the black feathers diluted to blue by the blue gene (Bl). Ideally each feather has black lacing. The plumage is a blue/gray color, but the eggs are true blue. A small percentage may be light green.\nBlue chickens do not breed true and our blue to blue matings produce approximately 50% blue chicks, 25% black chicks and 25% splash chicks.Â  We will send as many blues as we can in your order, but please also expect some black and splash Ameraucana chicks in your order.\nBecause our sexers have a hard time determining the gender of this breed, their vent sexing is only about 80% accurate. That is well below the normal average of 90% accuracy for other breeds. Please keep this in mind when ordering females.\nAlso to be noted is that this breed has an inherent genetic beak issue. One out of 100 chicks may develop scissor beak/cross beak of greater or lesser severity. This condition is best described as the top and bottom beak not aligning. And it normally gets worse as the chick grows. You can find more information about this issue on our Cackle Hatchery blog. Numerous articles about cross beak are also on the internet.\nBe ready to order your blue Ameraucana chicks as early as late November. You can request delivery any time from early February through early August."],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show ClassÂ":"Poultry Show Class:Â All Other Standard Breeds, Miscellaneous Class","Weights":"Â Hen ââ-5 1/2 lbs\nRoosterâ-6 1/2 lb\nPulletââ4 1/2 lbs\nCockerelâ5 1/2 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Laying blue eggs, pets and show; Production","Egg Shell Color":"blue shell a few light green","Egg Production":"Â 180-200 eggs per year (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Â Medium-Large","Temperament":"Â Active/Flighty","Gender AccuracyÂ":"Gender Accuracy:Â 75-80%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Non Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 9 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 4+ feet","Country of Origin":"Â USA","APA":"Â Yes,Â Recognized by the American Standard of Perfection in 1984.","TLC":"Â Not Listed","Breeder Farm Source":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding FarmÂ has been developing our bloodline/strain of production type Blue Ameraucana since 2015."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2p3fnrfso8"],"reviews":[{"id":"326233","rating":"5","author":"DB ","date":"2019-12-20T07:50:20-05:00","title":"Beautiful birds","review":"I ordered 6 blue Ameraucana hens last June along with 24 other chicks.

I didnât notice it until she was around a month old and it was only slightly crossed however as time went by it got much worse. I grind her food up and mix with water and usually feed her three times a day.

Less than 48 hours in transit â awesome! They came out of the box alert and energetic, they had no trouble finding and taking the food and water. One thing I did which I havenât seen anyone suggest, was to take a cup of their feed and crush it under a rolling pin. This reduced the particle size to about 1/4 of the supplied chickens crumble size. I put this in a low dish next to their main feeder with regular crumbles, they seemed to prefer the smaller pieces. I did sugar their water for the first two hours. I ordered six chicks â Iâm sure that two are black and three are blue, and I think the last is a splash. Theyâre all adorable, and they already have their own personalities! Iâm handling them often â I want them to learn to accept and trust me handling them, to facilitate care in the future. The splash? fell asleep in my hand! Anyway, great job.. wonderful chicks..

We are happy to present the White Crested Blue Polish chicken (non bearded) which are one of the best ornamental chicken breeds that are primarily used for exhibition. The Polish chicken is actually thought to have originally come from the Netherlands rathen than Poland, but the name was given when the birds were first transported from Poland and initially introduced in England. This old breed is thought to have been domesticated in Eastern Europe since the early 16th century. Like all other blue varieties of poultry, the White Crested Blue Polish do not breed true to color. Two blues mated together will produce a variety of splash, black-blue and blue chicks. Breeding splash to the black-blue version will produce the most offspring that are more uniform in blue color.\nThe primary purpose of the Polish Chicken today is for show and backyard oddity. Some refer to them as top hats or top knobs. Polish chickens are not known for going broody but will lay a good amount of white small to medium sized eggs throughout the year. This chicken is notable for the crest of feathers around its head, as well as its large nostrils. The crest of the male is a bit more erratic and umbrella shaped, while the hensâ crests are fluffy and full feathered. They make excellent pets but sometimes can have issues with drinking water in the winter time. Their top knob feathers get water logged as they drink and my need trimmed back.

They look super cute as chicks with the little cotton balls on their heads! I bought all hens with the exception of the polish as they are not sexed and 3 of the 4 turned out to be roosters. I found that they were pretty aggressive towards each other, they would peck at the tops of each others heads and try to fight from pretty early on so had to auction off 2 of the roosters. The one remaining got picked on the worst and now canât grow feathers out of the top middle of his head. His remaining crest of feathers does block his vision and heâs aggressive towards my female pekin duck so I donât allow him to free range with the others. This summer he mated with one of my buff orpington hens and one of the eggs that hatched has turned out to be a beautiful crested black and gold hen. The one blue polish hen lays small white eggs pretty regularly and is very beautiful, although skittish which is in their nature. While I love all my feather babies and wouldnât trade my two polish birds for anything, I donât think Iâll purchase more of them as I donât want to be stuck with roosters and donât like the skittish personality."},{"id":"326156","rating":"5","author":"Aaron ","date":"2019-12-11T01:21:02-05:00","title":"blue polish are fun","review":"We have enjoyed the 2 Blue Polish and 1 Black Polish hens, we also enjoy our Blue Polish rooster.

Won all-around poultry showman with the hen and both had Champion conformation ribbons. They are gentle, showy and small. Perfect for 4-H. She loved showing them to people.

Entering a poultry show with non-dubbed males of the Old English breed is a disqualification.

In the order (unbeknown to me) were two Bobwhite Quail. One was doa on arrival, the other was a male that was raised with the chickens. He was a blessing to say the least! While I had them caged together he had to constantly be on the run, but as soon as I could I let them all run free. He still hung out with the chickens but kept his distance. He even roosted in the trees with them. This seems crazy but when I would walk out of my house and he would see me ( sometimes 20 yards away) he would fly up to me. I would always have some grain to give him. It was so neat to see a bird that is shy in the wild to be so social. Unfortunately one day he spooked in the yard and sustained a wound when he flew into a fence. He died the next morning in my hands. I donât know how that little guy made his way in the box of chickens but Iâm so glad he did. I hope to get back on a farm some day soon and make an order from Cackle. That order will definitely include some Bobwhite Quail. I use to hunt quail.

The Leghorn breed of chicken is very athletic, mature early, are hardy, non-sitters and lay very nice large/X large white eggs. Leghorns are good layers of white eggs, laying an average of 280 per year and sometimes reaching 300â320.They have a good feed-to-egg conversion ratio, needing around 125 grams per day of feed. This chicken breed is great for free range chicken farming or organic free range chicken eggs. Leghorns rarely exhibit broodiness and are thus well suited for uninterrupted egg laying. The Leghorn is a light breed that matures quickly and is not considered a viable meat producer. Leghorns are active and efficient foragers and are one of the best for free range chickens that can avoid predators. They typically avoid human contact and tend to be nervous and flighty.

All of the birds arrived alive which is amazing since we are located in hawaii! I would like to point out that they give you a full list of what you ordered/ got extra which was a really nice touch. We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue. I would like to mention we ordered 10 roos that were all marked on their heads with paint which was amazing. Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle. With all of that being said they are still a hatchery and the birds arenât going to be the cream of the crop to say but they are damn close!

The Buff Brahma chickens have mostly buff coloring but have black tail feathers and neck feathers with black in them. They lay nice brown eggs and are winter hardy. The Buff Brahma chicken is slow to mature but are gentle and make good mothers. Brahmas are very cold tolerant and adapt to most climates because of their heavy body and thick feathering. The Brahma breed also does well in the summer months if there are shade and cool water available all day. The feathered legs and feet can collect mud in the rainy weather, and snow in the winter. Keep an eye on their feet and clean them if needed. The Brahmas stand out in a flock due to their large size. The rooster can weigh up to 12 pounds and the hen close to 10. Cackle HatcheryâsÂ® Buff Brahma bloodline is a mixture of exhibition/show type and production type. They have a big carcass for butchering, are below average for laying production but make great brooding hens for setting and hatching out baby chicks. Brahmas make some of the best mothers for brooding baby chicks.

One of them developed a gimpy leg around week 3-4 and couldnât walk properly. The rest of them grew into very large chickens. Theyâre pretty calm and quiet. I only had one rooster out of four that was an asshat and had to be eaten. The others get along fine with both other roosters and the hens, and donât bother them too much. They donât chase or peck when we go in the pen to collect the eggs. The eggs are definitely larger than most. Overall, Iâve been very happy with the way things went.

Not only will it behave well around your children, but it will excel at raising chicks and will easily go broody. We improved our Cackle Hatchery flock by adding some bloodline from Roland Doerr in 2009. This helped maintain their size and vigor, They are an excellent choice for a show or exhibition type.

They are white skinned, plump, and juicy for a great dressed out chicken. The Buff Orpington is one of the best chickens for sale online for dual egg and meat purposes. Many will put their 2 year old chickens in the stew pot and retain the 1 year old hens for laying eggs. Then buy more baby chicks for sale from Cackle HatcheryÂ® to keep the cycle going. This accomplishes the most efficient cost to feed ratio to raise chickens. Most chicken breed charts will list the Buff Orpington chicken as a dual purpose bird that lay a medium brown egg.

All of the birds arrived alive which is amazing since we are located in hawaii! I would like to point out that they give you a full list of what you ordered/ got extra which was a really nice touch. We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue. I would like to mention we ordered 10 roos that were all marked on their heads with paint which was amazing. Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle. With all of that being said they are still a hatchery and the birds arenât going to be the cream of the crop to say but they are damn close! If you want a decent flock with beautiful birds and you donât want to pay an absurd price to a private breeder cackle is your one stop shop!"},{"id":"325342","rating":"5","author":"Karen G.

I checked on then during break and brought a coworker to see them. They got the chicken bug. Hopefully a future Cackle Hatchery future customer. I got them home and they immediately started running about the brooder. Very happy healthy, vigorous chicks. I plan on keeping them that way. I am very satisfied with my first experience dealing with Cackle Hatchery.

They are also color sexable as chicks for the first generation which are the chicks you will receive. Cockerel chicks are white and the pullet chicks are more brownish red in color. Leg color is mostly yellow but a few may have some greenish color. Feathering color varies with brownish feathers and white feathers on the adult hens. Feathering color varies from totally white to white with light to dark red feathers in shoulder feathers in the adult rooster. Chicks from the second generation will not be color sexable and will come in multiple colors. The parent stock is made from a proprietary Cackle HatcheryÂ® bloodline/strain of the straight combed variety Rhode Island Red production type male and the straight combed variety Rhode Island White production type female.

The American Poultry Association (APA) subsequently changed the breed name to Cornish. This name reflects the breedâs origin in Englandâs Cornwall County.\nThese stout bantams have a fierce look, but are actually quite docile. They are active, talkative chickens that make nice pets. They are excellent foragers and the hens are good broodies.\nCornish bantam hens and roosters both have short, wide-set legs, muscular bodies, and a large, wide breast. Many people raise them as meat birds. At about 2 pounds each, one makes a nice size for serving one or two diners.\nCornish bantams are also popular for exhibition. They have a pea comb and tight feathering. The APA recognizes 8 color varieties, of which dark Cornish were the first and remain the most popular.\nThis breed does best in mild climates.

It was created by Reginald Crundall Punnett and Michael Pease in the early twentieth century at the GeneticalÂ  Institue of Cambridge University. It was developed by cross-breeding the Gold Legbar with White Leghorn and creme-colored Araucanas chicken. The Araucanas introduced the dilute creme gene (âinhibitor of goldâ) as well as the crest and the blue eggs into the variety. It was standardized in 1958 but nearly died out in the 1970âs as blue eggs were not in demand. Chicks can be sexed upon hatching by the down color and the pattern they form. They are both cold and heat hardy bird with an active, very curious, and charming personality. For a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nThe male has cream barred neck hackles and the saddle hackles are cream barred with dark grey and have cream tips. The back and the shoulders are mostly cream barred with dark grey. The wings have dark grey barred primaries and secondaries with cream tips. The breast and tail are barred dark grey and the crest is cream and grey. The female has softly barred cream neck hackles.

In the order (unbeknown to me) were two Bobwhite Quail. One was doa on arrival, the other was a male that was raised with the chickens. He was a blessing to say the least! While I had them caged together he had to constantly be on the run, but as soon as I could I let them all run free. He still hung out with the chickens but kept his distance. He even roosted in the trees with them. This seems crazy but when I would walk out of my house and he would see me ( sometimes 20 yards away) he would fly up to me. I would always have some grain to give him. It was so neat to see a bird that is shy in the wild to be so social. Unfortunately one day he spooked in the yard and sustained a wound when he flew into a fence. He died the next morning in my hands. I donât know how that little guy made his way in the box of chickens but Iâm so glad he did. I hope to get back on a farm some day soon and make an order from Cackle. That order will definitely include some Bobwhite Quail. I use to hunt quail.

All of the birds arrived alive which is amazing since we are located in hawaii! I would like to point out that they give you a full list of what you ordered/ got extra which was a really nice touch. We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue. I would like to mention we ordered 10 roos that were all marked on their heads with paint which was amazing. Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle.

Sorry I bothered you all, I just was concerned about their shipping in hot weather and trusting they had not been misdirected to some other Post Office.

Weâve been breeding these chickens for almost 40 years, and weâve perfected the development process. This specific variety, sold as baby chicks only, is notable for its pearl to blue leg color, as well as its single comb. You can expect these chickens to be very genetically hardy, and they are well known for their gameness. Place your order today, and make sure you give us a call if you have any questions! This is an excellent choice for someone to have a free-range flock of poultry (1 male and 10 hens). This flock will have a better chance of evading predators than most other poultry breeds. The hens make good brooding mothers for sitting on the eggs and hatching the baby chicks and raising them.\n NOTE: The Old English is photographed with a comb, ear lobes, and wattles dubbed (cut off). Entering a poultry show with non-dubbed males of the Old English breed is a disqualification.

I got my very first egg from this flock on the 17th of September.  These birds are quite docile and are very quite.  The two roosters that survived (one was attacked by something and died)  are not vocal at all as of yet and I know that they are sexually mature because they have been breeding the hens for a good two and a half weeks now.  Ive not heard them crow yet and Iâm not sure if that is a characteristic of the breed but Iâm not complaining!  The hens are pretty friendly and I have a couple that will seek out my attention when Iâm feeding or working in the coop area.  I havenât eaten any of these as the intention was to develop egg layers but at this point (four months old) I think they are still a little light and need to fill out some more.

Originated date is unknown and many of todayâs recognized breeds were developed by using Dominique bloodlines. Sometimes referred to as a âDomineckerâ chicken that grandma and grandpa had on their chicken farm. Dominique chicken breeders were well known in the USA during the mid-eighteenth century. By 1950 the Dominique chicken was thought to be extinct and revived again in 1970âs. The Dominique chicken is often confused with the Barred Rock chicken which has a straight comb and slightly straighter and darker barred markings. Dominiqueâs are a great bird with a notable rose comb, barred feathering similar to the Barred Plymouth Rock and a dual all-purpose chicken. Dominique chickens are generally calm, a gentle breed that makes for a good choice for raising free range chickens because of their barred feather pattern that is thought to offer some protection from aerial predators. Cackle HatcheryâsÂ® Dominique chicken flocks are a production type breeding program here at Cackle Hatchery. Mark Field was instrumental in providing Cackle Hatchery some seed stock decades ago. Mark passed in January 2021 and he will be missed by many in the poultry breeder world. We are sure you would like them for your chickens in the backyard.

The true pure Araucana chicken is rumpless (tailless) , has a small curling tuft of feathers next to each ear and come in different pure color types. The true pure Ameraucana chicken has a tail, full beard and comes in pure color types. The Easter Egger chicken is different because they have a full beard under the beak rather than a tuft and have a tail rather than rumpless and do NOT have pure color types. Cackle HatcheryÂ® breeding program objectives for the âEaster Eggerâ¢â chickens are to produce chickens with a wide variety of feather colors, patterns and feather combinations of colors with a full beard under the beak and high egg production of colorful egg shells. The color of their egg shells vary from pale blue chicken eggs to dark blue to various shades of green and a few light brownish/pink eggs. The meat is delicious and it has a taste similar to quail. We do not offer a specific color variety of this breed; however we do breed for a wide variety of colored feathers and egg colors. The Araucana chicken and Ameraucana chickens have a number of different color patterns being worked on all across the USA and are being shown in poultry shows. The Easter Eggerâ¢ chickens are great chickens for backyards, chicken coops, larger chicken houses and for raising free range chickens.\nFor a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nNOTE: It should be noted that this breed has an inherent genetic beak issue. 1 out of 100 chicks as they grow may have some variance in severity of scissor beak/cross beak.

We found that we enjoy chicken keeping and the different personalities of the birds so much we just had to get more, even though that means I need to get busy building another coop! Sure you can try to get chicks easier like a local TSC, but you have a few breeds to pick from, they may not be the best breeds for your area and the knowledge is just not there. Cackle has everything, explains everything and gives you the healthiest best birds possible. Besides the trip to the local post office to pick them up is a great experience as well.

Weâve ordered chicks from them several times now and it has been easy and straight forward and although we order small numbers and so have to pay the premium, they have been generous in ensuring we get the number of hens we ordered by usually including ~10% more chicks than the actual order. The chicks are always healthy and well packaged and weâve never had one die or need to be nursed alongâthe most weâve ever had to deal with was ONE chick that had pasty butt.

All of the birds arrived alive which is amazing since we are located in hawaii! I would like to point out that they give you a full list of what you ordered/ got extra which was a really nice touch. We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue. I would like to mention we ordered 10 roos that were all marked on their heads with paint which was amazing. Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle. With all of that being said they are still a hatchery and the birds arenât going to be the cream of the crop to say but they are damn close!

The loss was horrendous, and compounded by the fact that they were hatched by my youngest daughterâs first grade class.  We sat down as a family, and the seven of us narrowed it down to four breeds for a new batch of chickens.  3 Black Jersey Giants Females and 2 Males, 3 Black Laced Golden Wyandottes F , 3 Dominiques F, and 6 Easter Eggers F.  We have an existing adult flock of 10 mixxed Isa Browns, White Leghorn, and Easter Eggers, all Female.  We ordered two days before a hatch date.  We received our chicks two days later delivered to our door, after they got kicked out of the post office for being too loud. 23 chicks in wonderful shape; an extra male Giant, 2 extra female giants, 1 extra female Wyandotte, and 2 extra Easter Egger females.  We dipped little beaks in water and its been balls full out since then.  100% survival at 6 days old!!!  Perfect total flock ratio of 3 males and 30 females(Barring any surprise roosters).

We got our first OLIVE GREEN egg when they were about 23-24 weeks and have since received a minty green, pale blue, and a pale brown/pink egg. What cracks me up is that all of these hens have COMPLETELY different temperaments. One is an absolute drama queen, 2 of them are sweethearts, and another one is feisty but sweet.

The chicks from Cackle are much more hardy and healthy than those we purchased from a very reputable Iowa hatchery; weâve already lost one to a severe crop impaction, one to ovarian cancer and another has been living with a pendulous crop since April. Those from Cackle are also much friendlier, prettier and varied in their color.

They are gentle and allow me to doctor them with no fuss or pecking. The eggs are a beautiful sea foam green on most, some more pale than others.

I ordered 3 EE pullets and 3 Welsummer pullets and Cackle was nice enough to send an extra EE. All arrived safely and although theyâre only about two weeks old right now, they donât appear to have any sign of illness or deformities.  Iâm so excited to see what the EEs will look like and what color eggs theyâll have when theyâre older. Right now all the chicks are a pale yellow with some gray and tan, but thereâs enough variation between them even at this age that I think theyâll all look a little different when theyâre older. They seem to be slightly more comfortable around people than the Welsummers and one EE in particular would crawl into my hand on the first day and seems to enjoy being petted. Iâm hoping these gals will last me several years, but I would definitely order from Cackle again.

All 28 chicks arrived alive and well. Only one had pasty butt (one of the EE chicks) and I thought she would die but she pulled through (she grew up to lay med sized green eggs for me). I ordered 7 EE chicks and was sent an extra one for free. 4 black and 4 white/cream/pastel colored EE chicks. I lost 3 of them to a possum before they started to lay (my fault). Of the 5 still alive, one lays an extra large blue egg! Another lays a large blue green egg and three lay green eggs med to large in size. Overall, Iâm very happy with all my chickens from Cackles and expecially happy with my EE. They are good at free ranging during the day.

One has a scissor beak (manageable with proper beak care and feeding techniques), but all three are absolutely beautiful and have the absolute best personalities.  Some refer to these chickens as âchicken muttsâ  (one of mine actually looks to be mixed with salmon faverolles), but in my opinion, theyâre one of the neatest looking, friendliest, most laid back chicken breeds out there.  Seeing as that all three of mine came from different places and theyâre all amazing, I think that theyâre probably the best kept secret for backyard chicken keepers.  Whatâs also cool is that they come in so many different colors and sizes; no two look alike.  The baby I got from Cackle (her name is Eleanor) is an absolute doll and the belle of the coop.

From 5 hens I get a steady 3 eggs a day, but they do slow down during the winter months.  They are much more like a normal chicken compared to the Cornish Cross.  The Cornish Cross got to 17 pounds in 10 weeks! The Freedom Rangers got to about 8 to 12 pounds in 16 months.

It is close to the brown-red plumage but it is especially very similar to the froment (french term for wheat or wheaten) cockâs. It also has a coppery finery on a black plumage background to which is added a citananon-fawn colored wing miror and not the black miror of the brown-red variety. The breast must be black with a duller black abdomen. The hackles and the lancets are coppery colored with variable tonalities (from orangery to golden-coppery shades) and possibly bordered or not with black flames. The back and the small of the back are auburn-red colored with dark and velvet red shoulders. The miror is of course fawn or cinnamon brown colored and made up of folded wing secondary remexs. The tail is black, the primary remexs are pure and black and they make the armband. The cock also has on the tail base on the rump, a tuft of ash-gray downy feathers. The hen has a hackle that is light golden colored with black tips on a salmon reddish-brown breast. This latter color is close to the gray tone around the belly underside and the tail and close to reddish tones on the thighs. Be careful, this salmon color of the breast is a fundamental mark of this genetic variety. It gives its name to the variety and allows to avoid all confusion with the real genetic âpartridgeâ variety which never owns the least salmon tonality and which moreover seems not to exist in Marans. The coat is blackish-brown colored made up of a fine and blackish filigree on the feather. The coat shows a general warmer and brown tonality whereas that for the real âpartridgesâ, their shades have a quite colder and darker tonality. The wing remexs as well as the tail candal are also blackish-brown with little brown dots.\nWe hope to offer this project in 2024.\nAlso may like Dark Brown Egg Female SurplusÂ or French Marans Pullet Surplus.\nDisclosure NOTE: This color pattern is in the first stage of selective selection of color in 2017 and we cannot guarantee color uniformity at this time.\nSexing Note: Most of our breeds we can average 90% accuracy on gender sexing.

The Wheaten variety was recognized in October of 2011 at the Crossroads Show in Indianapolis, Indianaâ. The Wheaten line carries feathered shanks and amber eyes with light wheaten colored feathers. These birds are friendly, sociable and active. Roosters are very calm and can co-habitat nicely with each other. French Wheaten Marans are bred to lay dark chocolate eggs and are considered gourmet eggs. With the dark eggs during the laying cycle, as with all fowl eggs, the color will lighten as the laying season progresses. These are some beautiful birds to be on the farm and a great addition to your flock. Mahogany brown eggs but color with this variety is not as dark as with the Black Copper Marans. While the back color is fairly standard there are a variety of shades for the breast and rear ranging from almost white to deep red clay. Marans lay a large egg 2.3 oz for a pullet to 2.8 oz for a hen. They should have a consistently deep dark red-brown shell (minimum of 3 on the color chart). However with this being said our current flocks in 2015 produced about 5% clean legs. Our cackle flock lays egg shell colors of 5-8 on the French Marans Egg color chart found in the gallery.\nAlso may likeÂ Dark Brown Egg Female SurplusÂ orÂ French Marans Pullet Surplus.\nSexing Note: Most of our breeds we can average 90% accuracy on gender sexing.

In the order (unbeknown to me) were two Bobwhite Quail. One was doa on arrival, the other was a male that was raised with the chickens. He was a blessing to say the least! While I had them caged together he had to constantly be on the run, but as soon as I could I let them all run free. He still hung out with the chickens but kept his distance. He even roosted in the trees with them. This seems crazy but when I would walk out of my house and he would see me ( sometimes 20 yards away) he would fly up to me. I would always have some grain to give him. It was so neat to see a bird that is shy in the wild to be so social. Unfortunately one day he spooked in the yard and sustained a wound when he flew into a fence. He died the next morning in my hands. I donât know how that little guy made his way in the box of chickens but Iâm so glad he did. I hope to get back on a farm some day soon and make an order from Cackle. That order will definitely include some Bobwhite Quail. I use to hunt quail.

This specific variety has gold and black feathers, as well as pearl-colored legs. Order yours today and we will ship your chicks in no time! Inbreeding for the golden color, silver is a heavy factor in the process and a large percentage of silver crops out.

They are also color sexable as chicks for the first generation which are the chicks you receive. Chicks from the second generation will not be color sexable and will come in multiple colors. As chicks the cockerels are white and the pullets are more brownish red in color. Leg color is mostly yellow but will get some greenish.

I live close to the post office, so I clicked on my lights in this nice large brooder hubby just made for me, just as I was leaving the house.  All chicks immediately ate and drank.  Then they seemed to be weakening.  I then realized my heat was escaping and temp was about 95.  For these little birds, 105 is important.  I used some blankets over most of the top wire to keep heat in and a heating pad on low.  This brought the temp up to 105 and all the babies were happy and survived.

This chicken is very rare in the United States and not yet admitted to the American Standard of Perfection.

I was highly impressed with the packaging of the birds for shipment but my flock has began to die less than a month from them arriving. Upon research of the roosters symptoms is seems he possibly has a B12 deficiency, this could be due to food storage on my part or genetics but when I had 2 more birds die I became very concerned that it was more of a genetics issue. After the rooster passed I quickly threw out the food I had and began feeding them new food that was kept air tight, along with adding probiotics and electrolytes to their water. Thinking I was in the clear I return home from work to find 2 hens had passed as well. I am unable to find this breed available here or any other site so this has set me back possibly a year on my breeding.

Cackle HatcheryÂ® currently offers the âRoss 308â bloodline/strain. It is your best option for efficient feed/time to butcher weight and the best choice for meat chickens. Raise these chickens in a free range chicken coop and try out your best chicken recipe to delight your family.\nTips for Raising Jumbo Cornish Cross Chickens\nThe Jumbo Cornish Cross is developed specifically to harvest for meat. We do not recommend it as a pet or for breeding.\nWe also recommend raising these chickens separately from other poultry. Because of their fast growth rate they may trample smaller breeds.\nFeed a high protein ration that is 21% or better. To raise one chick to 8 weeks of age takes roughly 14 lbs of feed. At 8 weeks you can expect an average (averaging male and female) of 6Â½ pounds live weight.\nHarvest the Jumbo Cornish Cross broiler between 4 and 10 weeks of age, depending on desired weight. Cornish broiler chickens beyond this age will have health issues of the heart, bones, muscles, and tendons plus sores from sitting all the time.\nThese chickens grow so fast that their legs eventually give out from their weight. That plus fluid accumulating in the body cavity (Ascites) may make it necessary to restrict their feed intake to slow down the growth rate.\nYou can slow their growth rate by restricting feed intake. Remove their feed at night to give the bones and tendons time to catch up with the rapid muscle growth. However, when restricting feed, do not use small particle bedding (such as sawdust or small shavings). The birds will eat the bedding material, which can cause sickness and death.\nNote: The Cornish broiler may not do well if your elevation is 5,000 feet or more. They will be more prone to heart attacks and health issues at high altitudes. Please take this into consideration before ordering them.\nFor more information check out our blog âWhy Raise Cornish Cross Chickens.â We also recommend you request this book with your order:Â Raising Cornish-Cross Chickens for Meat.\nTo ensure safe delivery during hot weather, additional shipping charges may apply.\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â"],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show ClassÂ":"Poultry Show Class:Â Not Applicable","Weights":"Â Â Henââ6 lbs\nRoosterââ10 lbs\nPulletâ5 lbs\nCockerelâ-7-8 lbs\n6 wk pullets â 4 1/2 lbsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Cockerel â 6 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Meat; Production","Egg Shell Color":"Â Light Brown","Egg Production":"Â Poor","Egg SizeÂ":"Egg Size:Â Large","Temperament":"Â Docile","Fertility Percentage4":"0-55%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Non Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 4 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â Floor","Country of OriginÂ":"Country of Origin:Â United States","APA":"Â No","TLCÂ":"TLC:Â Not Listed"}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"available"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XY7VunhXia4","https://www.youtube.com/embed/l94EQQwY5RA"],"reviews":[{"id":"363424","rating":"5","author":"Beth ","date":"2020-05-15T16:01:29-05:00","title":"Rock Cornish","review":"These are the best birds I have ever raised.

First time in raising this breed. Excellent experience. Due to warmer weather, they were outside in their living quarters at 2 1/2 weeks old.

Average dressed weight, 2 1/2 lbs., which is fine for us. Temperatures were getting higher and higher â near 90 â and I didnât want to stress them out with the hot weather even though they had plenty of shade. All survived.

The largest dressed out at just under 6 pounds and the smallest was about 4 1/2 pounds. The meat is tender and juicy and sweet. Next time I will try another breed of meat bird. I would like to free range them like my egg layers.

It is one of the most popular and sought after Ameraucana varieties. Yet the American Poultry Association does not recognize lavender as an Ameraucana color variety.\nThe large fowl lavender Ameraucana chicken was create by Master Breeder John W Blehm in 2005. Another term for the color lavender is self blue. The blue (Bl) color variety looks similar to lavender. But it does not breed true. The lavender gene (LAV) does breed true. A lavender chicken bred to a lavender chicken will produce only lavender chicks. However, the lavender variety has an associated feather quality issue. Often it causes frayed or tattered tails, especially on males.\nFor a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nNOTE: Our sexers have a hard time determining the gender of the Ameraucana breed. As a result, their vent sexing on this breed averages about 80% accurate. The normal average is 90% accuracy for most other breeds. Please keep this in mind when ordering females.\nAs a breed, the Ameraucana has an inherent genetic beak issue. One out of 100 chicks may develop scissor beak/cross beak of varying degrees of severity. Scissor beak occurs when the top and bottom beak fail to align. It typically gets worse as the chick grows. You can find more information about this issue on our Cackle Hatchery blog. Numerous articles on the internet provide more information on this subject.\nOur lavender Ameraucanas are in limited supply. Order yours as early as late November for delivery in mid March to early August. You will love these baby chicks. They will grow up to lay beautiful blue eggs, and occasionally a light green egg, for your table."],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show ClassÂ":"Poultry Show Class:Â Large Fowl (All Other Standard Breeds)","Weights":"Â Hen ââ-5 1/2 lbs\nRoosterâ-6 1/2 lb\nPulletââ4 1/2 lbs\nCockerelâ5 1/2 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Laying blue eggs, pets and show: Production","Egg Shell Color":"blue shell a few light green","Egg Production":"Â 180-200 eggs per yearÂ (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Â Medium-Large","Temperament":"Â Active/Flighty","Gender AccuracyÂ":"Gender Accuracy:Â 75-80%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Non Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 9 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 4+ feet","Country of Origin":"Â USA","APA":"Â No","TLC":"Â Not Listed","Breeder Farm Source":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding FarmÂ has been developing our bloodline/strain of production type Lavender Ameraucana since 2015."}],"availability":{},"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCJ8eRv7i6c","https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EaI_9Xdun8?t=29"],"reviews":[{"id":"458233","author":"Cackle Hatchery ","date":"2021-06-03T16:32:27-05:00","review":"Looks like we did refund you by check on April 20th."},{"id":"363446","rating":"2","author":"LJ ","date":"2020-05-20T02:21:05-05:00","title":"We lost the chicken lottery ","review":"We placed our order early January and we were so excited to get our birds .

The âlavenderâ gene (lav) in the chicken causes the dilution of both black and red/brown pigments, so according to color background, dilution due to âlavenderâ gives a sort of plumageÂ color patterns: On an extendedÂ background, this condition causes the entire surface of the body an even shade of light slaty blue, which is the typical phenotype known as ââself-blueââ."],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":"Â English Class","WeightsÂ":"Weights:Â Henââ8 lbs\nRoosterââ10 lbs\nPulletâ7 lbs\nCockerelâ-8 1/2 lbs","PurposeÂ":"Purpose:Â DualÂ Egg Laying and meat; Exhibition","Egg Shell ColorÂ":"Egg Shell Color:Â Brown","Egg Production":"150+ eggs per year (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Medium","Temperament":"Â Docile","Fertility Percentage":"Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 5 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 2 to 4 feet","Country of OriginÂ":"Country of Origin:Â England","APAÂ":"APA:Â No","TLC":"Graduated from priority list in 2016","BREEDER FARM SOURCEÂ":"BREEDER FARM SOURCE:Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding FarmÂ has been developing our bloodline or strain of Lavender Orpington since 2017."}],"availability":{},"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nci4ooitKo","https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfJvjVZNPqo","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOFCkOwl7oE"],"reviews":[{"id":"325911","rating":"5","author":"Jonathan ","date":"2019-11-22T23:16:19-05:00","title":"Very Pretty Chickens","review":"Bought 4 female sexed Lav Orps and received 5.

Their small pea comb, great size, and heavy plumage make them almost immune to cold weather. They have feathered legs, good layers of brown eggs and excellent brood mothers, and very children friendly for pets. The Light Brahma chickens have mostly white coloring but have black tail feathers and neck feathers with black in them. The Brahmas stand out in a flock due to their large size. The rooster can weigh up to 12 pounds and the hen close to 10. They are good for meat because of their size. Cackle HatcheryÂ® offers our production type Light Brahma and not the exhibition type.\nBrahmas adapt to most climates. With their heavy body and thick feathering, they are very cold tolerant. In the summer, if they have shade and water, they get along fine. The feathered legs and feet can collect mud in the rainy weather, and snow in the winter. Keep an eye on their feet and clean them if needed.\nSee all brahma chicken color options we have for sale.

The domanique on the other hand are very noisy and trample each other when feeding or changing water. No matter how slow you go. Even had to separate 2 domanique runts that hurt their legs in the daily trample. They recovered fine. Overall the brhama are amazing. We have decided to change our flock over the them exclusively.

I know that you ship thousands of birds each month and Iâm sure they donât mean the same to a large hatchery but the 16 you shipped me are so special to my family. They will be pets split up to three different homes when they are a little larger, so please thank each person involved with this transaction for selecting these babies for us. I guess Iâd like each of them to know that they were responsible for selecting 5 Black Australorps, 5 Light Brahma and 6 Buff Orpington pullets for loving homes and lives that wonât end in the slaughter house.

You had some Blue Slate turkeys available when I got there so I thought OK I will try 6. What were the chances of getting 3 pairs, 3 toms and 3 hens? They are growing in leaps and bounds and everyone who sees them ask me where I got them. I am so PROUD to say Cackle Hatchery. Next year I will be ordering the Royal Palms turkeys also. Your staff is so knowledgeable. They looked over my order and noticed one of my chicks wasnât a Light Brahma or a Wyandotteâ¦they all looked the same to me so they added another chick to the order. I said it didnât matter what kind just surprise me. Well they were right, one of the chicks is different and the added chick turned out to be a Dark Brahma so either way I was happy. I have already been going over the catalog planning next springs order. I am thinking âBROILERSââ¦yummy! Thank you for the high quality birds and even higher quality staff.

I want to commend you. They arrived carefully packaged with the somewhat larger chicks in a separate space and all looking spry and safe. I had sworn I would never order from a hatchery again after an absolutely HORRIBLE experience one time with another hatchery. If you order less than 25 they put in extra chicks for warmth during shipping. i didnât know that having never ordered them before and I ordered 20 banties. Some person put in extra-regular-size chicks (leghorns) with the banties and seven of my little banties were crushed in transit. Nevertheless, nothing would bring back those poor little chicks and I knew I would never do business with them again. When we have occasion to order chicks again, you can be assured it will be from Cackle Hatchery."},{"id":"170383","author":"Mark Ohio March 2014 ","date":"2015-11-18T16:04:46-05:00","title":"Thanks Guys!

Got them home, opened the box and their were 18 healthy chicks looking at me like, âGet me out of here!!â  I dipped their beaks in the water as instructed but I was expecting somewhat lethargic chicks.  Not these!  They tried wiggling out of my hand and fought the attempt.  Once in the bedding, they went right after the food on the paper towel and others went to the feeders.  All found the water within 5 minutes.  Iâm leaving AC off while their in my basement cause itâs 90 degrees outside, 80 inside, but only two went under the heat lamp for a couple minutes.  The rest are eating and drinking like they own the place.

They are a very active breed and do well at shows. The males can be very aggressive toward other birds. The Antwerp Belgian were recognized by the American Poultry Standard of Perfection in 1949. The National Antwerp Belgian Society was organized September 1, 1961 in Durham, North Carolina. In 1965 the word National was dropped from the name. Thereafter the words âsocietyâÂ  and âAntwerpâ were removed. Although the breed is still known in Germany and England as Antwerp Belgians, we in America call them dâAnvers. The name âanverâ is a section in Belgian which claims the origin of the this chicken bantam breed. Around 1970 the newly named Belgian dâAnver Club of America started districts throughout the United States.

In the order (unbeknown to me) were two Bobwhite Quail. One was doa on arrival, the other was a male that was raised with the chickens. He was a blessing to say the least! While I had them caged together he had to constantly be on the run, but as soon as I could I let them all run free. He still hung out with the chickens but kept his distance. He even roosted in the trees with them. This seems crazy but when I would walk out of my house and he would see me ( sometimes 20 yards away) he would fly up to me. I would always have some grain to give him. It was so neat to see a bird that is shy in the wild to be so social. Unfortunately one day he spooked in the yard and sustained a wound when he flew into a fence. He died the next morning in my hands. I donât know how that little guy made his way in the box of chickens but Iâm so glad he did. I hope to get back on a farm some day soon and make an order from Cackle. That order will definitely include some Bobwhite Quail. I use to hunt quail.

They need to follow the others or become disoriented and are difficult to herd when I call them to go into the run.

If you arenât familiar with this rare breed chicken, it was originally developed in Japan and we have been the main breeder in the USA since 1977. As the name implies, this specific variety is notable for the red feathering in the shoulder area, mixed in with the traditional white feathers. The birds have an upright carriage and pheasant-like body and the roosters are noted for their extremely long saddle feathers and tail feathers which is the primary emphasis for exhibitors of this chicken breed. Under the right conditions the tail can grow up to 2-3 feet every year. The Red Shouldered Yokohama was admitted into the American Standard of Perfection in 1981 and this variety will also compete very well at any poultry show.Â For more details about this chicken breed, contact us today!"],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":"Â All Other Standard Breeds, Orientals Class","Weights":"Â Hen ââ-3 1/2 lbs\nRoosterâ-4 1/2 lb\nPulletââ-3Â lbs\nCockerelâ4 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Ornamental, Show; Exhibition","Egg Shell Color":"Â Cream or Tinted","Egg Production":"Â Fair","Egg Size":"Small","Temperament":"Â Active","Fertility Percentage":"Â 40-55%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Variable","Mating Ratio":"Â 8 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 4+ feet","Country of Origin":"Â Japan","APA":"Â Yes, Recognized by American Standard of Perfection in 1981","TLC":"Â Critical status, Considered a sustainable heritage chicken breed.","Breeder Farm Source":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding Farm has been developing our bloodline/strain of Red Shouldered Yokohama since 1977."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQxOlUInDw0","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQm_wZ9GZ0M","https://www.youtube.com/embed/OaTSUFNp6K4"],"reviews":[{"id":"326231","rating":"5","author":"Yokomama ","date":"2019-12-18T18:43:04-05:00","title":"Delightful Birds!","review":"Chicks came on time and were housed jointly with some Rhode Island Reds; came up with a solid strategy to improve early survival using natural products that matched survival rates with Amprolium â treated starter (100% survival).  The Yokos were surprisingly robust for small fancy birds, and had no trouble living with the RIRs in a normal coop scenario where they all shared food/water and space. They were also very docile and didnât mind being handled in the least.  Their ultimate demise was cold intolerance; lost all but one the first night it got close to freezing.

The Single Comb Rhode Island Red chicken is our most popular breed for brown egg laying production. They are a popular chicken choice for backyard chicken flocks because of their egg laying abilities and hardiness. Rhode Island Red chicks are a good choice for raising baby chickens naturally and raising baby chickens for eggs. Non-industrial strains of the Rhode Island Red are listed as recovering by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. Cackle HatcheryÂ®âs blood line or stain is a heritage chicken production type and bred pure by Cackle HatcheryÂ® Farms since 1936.\nThe Rhode Island Red is a true heritage chicken breed picked as a great choice for egg production. Many breeders breed the Rhode Island Red chicken for show, these are a little darker red and do not produce as many eggs. The Roosters usually weigh in at 8.5 pounds (3.9 kg), The Hens weigh slightly less at 6.5 pounds (2.9 kg), cockerel at 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg), and pullets at 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg).

I have had chickens for two years and I could not be happier with them. Their feathers shine and their eggs are the best I have ever had. My hens have helped me in more ways than one. You see, it is my ambition to own my own farm one day, so all experience helps. Not to mention their charming personalities. For example, my Barred Rock, Violet is a little silly and my RIR Raspberry is very smart for a chicken, My hens are one of my personal joys.\nI started getting chickensi in May of 2014, after doing a paper on them for learning purposes. Originally I planned on getting chicks simply to earn money, but as soon as I saw them I was immediately in love. The small fluffy bodies and cheeps are impossible to resist. I renew my flock every year in the spring, typically this is because a fox has recently gotten at my girls. However in a way this is good because I have had many different breeds. I was introduced to chickens by one of my parentâs colleagues and have had them ever since.\nThank you again for my gorgeous girls. Also it would be amazing if you could breed a duck, chicken combo. A bird that could lay eggs and swim, this would be useful because than you could own a pool and just leave it open in the summer instead of spending a lot of time creating shade, or even installing air conditioning to your coop. Finally thank you. Just thank you, for my girls."},{"id":"171766","author":"Skipper ","date":"2017-10-24T13:22:36-05:00","title":"Great Results!","review":"Our Rhode Island Red hens that were delivered on Good Friday of 2017 have matured into pretty ladies and now productive ones to boot!

They are safely in the brood box (a very large storage bin sitting on a table above the potential for any trouble with dogs or other critters) with large chips on the floor and the heat lamp getting them warmed up.

I just received our second batch of chicks from you today (50 each of Buff Orpington, Rhode Island Reds and White Leghorns) and I just have to say; I have raised and ordered chicks for many, many years as a private chicken fanatic and this is the first time I have experienced chicks on a retail level. Your chicks arrive healthy, robust and on time. All of our chick buyers are told up front that their are coming from Cackle Hatchery. We have a 98% survival rate once they hit our store and I think that says a lot for your quality and our care once they are in our hands. Thank you for all the hard work that you do on your end and once those chicks are in my hands I do everything i can to see that they are properly cared for and ready to go on to their new homes.

They are doing quite well, one or two of the chicks has a soft poop but still seem to be full of energy. Being I never experienced chicks before, I was really surprised at how fast they grow. On the fifth day I had to extend my wall of the brooding area because they would jump and or fly over my twelve inch high pen. I did lose one of the barred rocks around the third or fourth day. I actually expected to lose two or three but I am blessed to have lost only one.

Each time we have spoken with customer service they have been polite, knowledgeable and have plenty of time to educate us and help us. They never pushed anything on us or rushed us. I would like to give special acknowledgement to Bettina. She was our rep for the 2 orders placed today. She surpassed all our expectations today. Which is saying quite a lot since Cackle Hatchery has set the bar so high till now anyway. She is a true asset to your company. She even took the time to help us identify our âmysteryâ chicken.

They were feral chickens living on Saipan, the largest of the Northern Mariana Islands, when a few were brought to the United States in 1945. They have since became extinct in Saipan due to extensive crossbreeding.\nSaipans have tight feathering and shorter tail feathers than most other breeds.

The Sicilian Buttercup chicken originated on the Island of Sicily. It has a beautiful cup-shaped comb. A great barnyard or show fowl that is sure to please everyone. It is a delicate bird and is not winter hardy as most breeds of chickens are. The Sicilian Buttercup Chicken does not take well to confinement and more of a free range very active chicken. This chicken breed also does not go broody.\nIn 2013 we stopped breeding the buttercup breed because we were unable to stop the progression of the Buttercup cup comb from splitting apart a little more each year as we were producing the next generation. Although we had used this bloodline since 1971 we ran our course with any new genetics to infuse. We were unable to find another bloodline that had the quality that we used to have on this breed. So we made a decision not to continue breeding the Buttercup chicken breed and offering it until we could find another bloodline to work with.\nIn 2020 & 2021 we found 2 breeders that were willing to give us some seed stock to work with. In 2023 we started offering the Buttercup again."],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":"Â Mediterranean Class","Weights":"Â Hen ââ-5 lbs\nRoosterâ-6/12 lb\nPulletââ-4Â lbs\nCockerelâ5 1/2 lbs","Purpose":"Â Exhibition and egg laying","Egg Shell Color":"Â White","Egg Production":"Â Good","Country of Origin":"Â Italy","APA":"Â Yes, Recognized by American Standard of Perfection in 1918","TLC":"Watch Status, Considered a sustainable heritage chicken breed","Breeder Source Farm":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding Farm has been developing our bloodline or strain of pure Sicilian Buttercup chickens since 1971."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/gF14sf4j3k8","https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvnpznfXXNA"],"reviews":[{"id":"171035","author":"Theresa ","date":"2016-02-10T13:53:26-05:00","title":"Love it!","review":"I have one and sheâs great!

Every spring I get a new breed or two. The only chickens I keep into ripe old age are the Spitzhaubens (the rest get given away or stewed after about three years), because by then each of them has declared herself to have a unique personality. Our only chicken to have a name was Mary, a spitzhauben. She lived 14 years, survived record setting floods, attack by a Great Horned owl (who took a slower moving cornishX instead), predation by wandering beagle, possum, foxâ¦.Even at 14 years old she was the top hen in the flock. Sheâd get loose and follow us around, chatting amiably. All our friends knew her by name because she would greet them as they walked up the path to the door. She just perished this spring when the coyotes found our barn which I had forgotten to close one night ð âI found her body close to the entrance, and I am pretty sure she died defending the flock.

The hens are equally stunning in appearance & we had no bad apples behaviorally. They all develop slightly different spot patterns (unique to the individuals, like spots on a dalmation or stripes on a tiger), which helps family members & guests tell them apart better than if you got solid colored common breeds- which are identified with greater effort, knowledge of personalities, or giving them bracelets/legbands. Our roosters also each grew slightly varying mowhawks of feathers on their heads (come on, can these chickens look any more awesome? I think not). After over a decade of bird experience & all the bird companions Iâve worked with/raised, I have to say Cackle Hatchery really left a good impression on us with wide selection, reasonable prices, speedy delivery of healthy peeping babies packed carefully, & zero chick losses of order. Whether youâre looking for some character-filled companion birds, or enjoying raising good-tempered hens who gift you healthy eggs at home, these chickens should definitely cross your mind.  I notice people label birds as âdual-purposeâ sometimes; Silver Spangled Appenzeller Spitzhaubens do not grow freakishly fast (aka- obese in couple weeks), they are heritage breed birds which grow at a NORMAL growth rate- You can still eat them & enjoy the meat, if you plan on keeping chickens for longer than a couple weeks or if you want to establish a long-term flock, these birds will be more apt to develop healthier & have the potential to live longer than overly inbred or genetically altered breeds. Half our flock are S.S.A.S.- the eggs are delicious & the rate of lay is perfect for a family. Plenty for us, with a little to share or trade with friends. Donât be discouraged by first eggs being tiny, they get bigger as the hen continues growing & level off at medium size."},{"id":"325891","rating":"5","author":"Rich ","date":"2019-11-22T01:30:21-05:00","title":"Great chickens","review":"I have a verity of chickens from cackle.

Theyâre gorgeous birds, upright in build and beautifully marked. I was pleasantly surprised at their appealing personalities and intelligence. The roosters arenât aggressive, which was a relief; I wonât have a nasty-tempered rooster here. Theyâre smart birds: One of the hens gently tugs at my pants leg when Iâm not feeding them fast enough, and one of the roosters likes to escape from the run daily and greet me halfway to the house or barn when Iâm doing livestock chores, then keeps me company. They lay a smaller, perfectly white well-formed egg, and although  they donât keep up with the Marans for egg quantity, they arenât slackers, either. Theyâre not easy to catch but neither are they crazy flighty, and they get along well with the rest of the poultry. They arenât fighters and they arenât bullies. I recommend the breed for anyone who wants to add some dazzle to their flock or who enjoys birds with interesting personalities â or even those who will enjoy announcing, âIâve got some Silver Spangled Appenzeller Spitzhaubensâ to friends."},{"id":"171782","author":"Ken ","date":"2017-11-04T01:06:14-05:00","title":"Happy with our order ","review":"We ordered 20 silver spangled Spitzhauben from Cackle to be delivered 2 May, 2017.

They are good foragers, not flighty and generally fit in well with our flock (80+ birds). We did butcher the roosters as they are my sons FFA egg layers.

This breed was thought to have originally come from the Netherlands but got its name when it was transported from Poland and introduced to England. This very old domesticated breed of poultry is mentioned as early as the sixteenth century in history. Several varieties were admitted to the American Standard of Perfection from 1874-1996.\nThe Polish breed is noted for being one of the most beautiful and ornamental breeds. They are prized exhibition and show fowl. The bearded and non-bearded of each variety can be found at shows throughout the United States. The Silver Laced Polish chicken is the most striking in appearance of the âPoland Fowls.â They have a full crest of feathers that grow out of a knob on the skull and large cavernous nostrils.

All 5 were delivered to my post office, who called me when they arrived so I could pick them up right away. My chicks have since developed into beautiful birds with beautiful plumage. The only negative I would say is that 4 out of 5 birds ended up being males which I was hoping wouldnât happen. But our family still loves them anyways!  We get so many comments on how beautiful and unique our birds are. They arenât aggressive birds at all.

The Speckled Sussex are the friendliest chickens that Iâve raised so far. I didnât expect them to tame down so much, but they are always on your lap or following nearby (or trying to find you through the windows of your house when they can hear you, haha). They are pretty noisy. These chickens greatly enjoy being outside, so they get the least amount of coop time Iâm able to allow. They are very beautiful in the yard and are just delightful and oh so curious. I have enjoyed this breed more than any that I have raised over the years. The rooster does get a little âterritorialâ sometimes, but has not been overly aggressive, thus far. I look forward to keeping these great chickens for a while. As usual, this hatchery was great. All chicks arrived healthy and active. One did get sick, and I thought was going to die, but pulled through and she is now one of the more active, vibrant hens in the bunch.

We had always talked about having back yard chickens and finallydecided to go for it this summer. We researched all early summer, began building our custom coop and finally decided on the breed we really wanted. Next on the list was to check out the hatcheries. We also did our research in this department. We found ourselves falling in love with your hatchery. We watched the videos, read reviews and made our decision.\nOn our way home from vacation in July we made an off the beat detour to come visit your hatchery and grab a bite from your restaurant across the street (best food ever). We took a peek at the chicks available, bought a few things from your store and placed our order for 5 speckled Sussex pullets. We were giddy all the way home knowing our girls would arrive later that week. When the girls arrived we were pleasantly surprised to find not 5, but 6 very active chicks. They were so sweet, even the postal ladies were sad to see them go.\nWe headed home for a brand new adventure and the fun has yet to stop. We have been amazed at how fun and fast growing the girls are. We learn new things daily and we were even sad when it was time to move them outside. Like parents whose child is moving away from home for the first time. Everyday they are relaxing and entertaining to watch and taking over more of our hearts. They are all healthy and happy so we thought we would share a few pictures we just took of them at 6 1/2 weeks. Tossed in a couple of younger ones and the coop as well. We hope you enjoy them."},{"id":"171605","author":"KnoxT ","date":"2017-05-16T17:33:17-05:00","title":"Speckled Sussex","review":"Bought chicks in past locally for 5 years.

But that is okay because they are all friendly, gorgeous, and healthy!  I highly recommend them!  Second order Feb. Iâve had two delays and changes to my last order of Black Ameracauna, Buff Brahma, Jumbo Cornish X, and Red Broilers.  Order changed to May 3.  But that is okay!  Later means warmer and I donât have to worry about snowstorms so much for the chicks.  The Cx last year were excellent and healthy!  Not like the feed store birds.

Our chicks have been nothing short of SPLENDID from you, always arriving warm, dry and healthy. Our customers have been very pleased with their chicks, some even bring me photos of last yearâs chickens, boasting about their egg production and health of their flock. We have enjoyed many repeat customers based on the over-all happiness of the chicks, that although come from our store YOU are the ones that deserve the accolades. Our store is the smallest in our chain but we have never been treated as if we were not as important as other stores with larger orders by your staff. Just this last Monday I called needing to put in an âEmergencyâ order as we quickly ran out of chicks that had just arrived 3 days earlier. I had to have new chicks in the store no later than Friday. I was wonderfully taken care of and sent via the phone to someone that could help me out in your âover-hatchâ. One hundred more chicks were not only ordered but shipped that day to my store. They arrived this morning right on time and in excellent health. i have had chickens all my life, dealt with many hatcheries but I can say without a doubt I have been most impressed by your customer service and quality of chicks.

Thank you."}]},{"name":["Splash Ameraucanas Chicken"],"description":["Splash Ameraucanas are mostly white birds with random splashes of blue to black color in their feathers.Â  These attractive chickens are easy to create by breeding two blue Ameraucanas together.Â Since blue doesnât breed true, blue, black and splash chicks may hatch.\nSplash does breed true, though. So splash bred to splash produces only splash chicks.Â Splash and black are co-dominant. So splash bred to black results in all blue chicks.\nCackle HatcheryÂ® started offering blue egg laying splash Ameraucanas in 2018. A small percentage will lay eggs with shells in shades of light green. Splash Ameraucanas are not a recognized standard variety by the American Poultry Association. For a list of the best blue egg layers visit Cackle Hatcheryâs Best Blue Egg Layers Blog.\nNOTE: Our sexers have a hard time determining the gender of the Ameraucana. So their vent sexing on this breed is about 80% accurate on the average, and well below the normal average accuracy of 90% for other breeds. Please take this into consideration when ordering females.\nAlso, the Ameraucana breed has an inherent genetic beak issue. One out of 100 chicks, as they grow, may have some variance in severity of scissor beak/cross beak. This condition occurs when the top and bottom beak donât align. The condition normally gets worse as the chick grows. You can find more information about this issue on our Cackle Hatchery blog. Numerous articles and information on the Internet cover this subject.\nMake plans to order your splash Ameraucana chicks as soon as late November. They hatch and ship from early February through early August."],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show ClassÂ":"Poultry Show Class:Â All Other Standard Breeds, Miscellaneous Class","Weights":"Â Hen ââ-5 1/2 lbs\nRoosterâ-6 1/2 lb\nPulletââ4 1/2 lbs\nCockerelâ5 1/2 lbs","Purpose and Type":"Â Laying blue eggs, pets and show; Production","Egg Shell Color":"blue shell a few light green","Egg Production":"Â 180-200 eggs per yearÂ (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Â Medium-Large","Temperament":"Â Active/Flighty","Gender AccuracyÂ":"Gender Accuracy:Â 75-80%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Non Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 9 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 4+ feet","Country of Origin":"Â USA","APA":"Â No","TLC":"Â Not Listed","Breeder Farm Source":"Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding FarmÂ has been developing our bloodline/strain of production typeÂ Splash Ameraucana since 2017."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"available"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAVERr6qLts"],"reviews":[{"id":"364809","rating":"5","author":"Ari ","date":"2020-07-04T05:27:30-05:00","title":"Beautiful!

A number of the color varieties were admitted into the American Standard of Perfection in 1965. We do not offer any specific color variety of this breed.

Of course I said yes! I ordered 50, and only 50 were shipped. (No extras) All but one was very lively and ready to eat and drink. One was sluggish and died that day, and another died the next day. But 2 deaths out of 50 are still great odds considering the long mail trip to NC, and I will not complain. They are now 3 weeks old and growing fast. Still healthy and full of energy.

Developed in the 1900âs it was first imported into this country in 1928 for its large brown egg. The Welsummer eggs will vary in tints of dark brown eggs and most of the eggs will have a real dark speckled pigment in the egg shell. The Welsummer is a large, upright, active bird with a broad back, full breast, large full tail and a single comb. Welsummers have a docile and friendly personality. The famed Kelloggâs Rooster was a Welsummer chicken. The Welsummer roosters are glorious with their beautiful shades of red and black. They are a fast growing bird and a very rare breed here in the United States.

We lost one bird at a few days old but Cackle sent us 60 birds instead of 50 so it wasnât an issue.

Fast forward a few months. all of the birds made it besides that one we lost in the first few days. We have a few extra roos that we didnt order but I think they gave them to us because we ordered 5 buff roos and 5 jersey roos but zero egger roos. Also, all of the birds are very healthy and all seem to be growing to breed standards. I couldnât be happier with my order. I have ordered from other hatcheries in the past and I have had many issues (wrong chickens, dead/ sick birds, bad packaging, the list goes on) none of those issues happened when I ordered from cackle.

God help us, I lost about four chicks- Walmart because of the âCovid-19â had closed early & we could not find a SAFE heat lamp source for them, I cobbled together one mechanicâs lamp, house lamp, equaling 175 Watts. Temps now at 100F in âbrooderâ & all so far made it. Ive less than the âover-ageâ of the 15 chicks I ordered, but that was due to owner error & not planning for emergencies (& this is someone who KNEW better, no excuse) I am very pleased & satisfied with the quality of chicks.

They were admitted to the American Standard of Perfection in 1874 and originates from Italy, Denmark, and England. This breed is very athletic, hardy, non-sitters and lay very nice large/X large white eggs. They have a good feed-to-egg conversion ratio, needing around 125 grams per day of feed. This chicken breed is great for free range chicken farming or organic free range chicken eggs. Â Leghorns rarely exhibit broodiness and are thus well suited for uninterrupted egg laying. The Leghorn is a light breed that matures quickly and is not considered a viable meat producer. Leghorns are active and efficient foragers and are one of the best for free range chickens that can avoid predators. However, the white variety of the leghorn might be easily seen by predators. They typically avoid human contact and tend to be nervous and flighty.

"}]},{"name":["White Plymouth Rock Chicken"],"description":["The White Plymouth Rock chicken was recognized as a distinct chicken breed and admitted to the American Standard of Perfection as a pure breed chicken in 1888. The White Plymouth Rock chicken is a good dual purpose chicken, a good pet chicken, a member of the Plymouth Rock family and known by their short name as a white rock chicken. A great American poultry heritage chicken breed that grandma and grandpa would have on the farm. They lay large to extra large brown eggs and the cockerels make very good fryers. White Rocks hens have similar characteristics as the Barred Rocks, except they are pure white in color. As chicks, however the chick fuzz can be white to all shades of dark smoky color turning to white feathers as new juvenile feathers emerge. As adults, they will have yellow legs, however as young chicks and juvenile chickens some will have darker leg color. They are graceful, inquisitive, friendly and easy to manage. White Rocks hens are not as popular as the Barred Rocks, they have soft feathers and a dawn like undercoat, making them very cold hardy. White Rocks are great chickens to have in a backyard flock. White Rocks hens start laying eggs on average at about 5 months after hatching and are among some of the earliest maturing laying hens. White Rock hens, like most laying hens, will go through a period of chicken feather molting, usually after laying for several months. During the molting period the hens wonât lay eggs and their pelvic bones will become not as wide. They may lose feathers and get pretty rough looking. Their faces will turn from a bright red to a pale pinkish color and it may take several weeks (4-8 weeks) to be done with the molting. When their face, comb and wattles become red again and the hens begin to sing you will know they are about to resume laying eggs. The White Rock chicken continues to be used as the female breeding side of the commercial Cornish Broiler Cross chicken. Cackle HatcheryÂ® offers this great dual purpose White Rock chicken for sale and hope you consider adding this great heritage breed chicken to your backyard chicken flock.\nWe also offer at limited times of the year White Plymouth Rock Fertile Hatching Eggs"],"breed_facts":[{"Poultry Show Class":"Â American Class","WeightsÂ":"Weights:Â Henââ7 1/2 lbsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Roosterââ9 1/2 lbs\nPulletâ6 lbs Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cockerelâ-8 lbs","Purpose and TypeÂ":"Purpose and Type:Â Primary production, Egg Laying & Pet/Secondary meat source","Egg Shell Color":"Â Brown","Egg Production":"Â 200 â 280Â eggs per year (estimates only, seeÂ FAQ)","Egg Size":"Â Large","Temperament":"Â Docile","Gender Accuracy":"Â 85-90%","Fertility PercentageÂ":"Fertility Percentage:Â 65-80%","BroodyÂ":"Broody:Â Setter","Mating Ratio":"Â 10 Females to 1 Male","Roost Height":"Â 2 to 4 feet","Country of Origin":"Â United States","APA":"Yes, Recognized by the Standard of Perfection in 1888","ALBC":"Recovering status, Considered a Heritage Sustainable Chicken Breed","Breeder Farm SourceÂ":"Breeder Farm Source:Â Cackle HatcheryÂ® Poultry Breeding Farm has been developing our bloodline or strain of White Plymouth Rock chicken since 1937."}],"availability":[{"date":"04/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"04/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"04/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/01/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/08/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/15/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/22/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/29/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"05/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/12/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/21/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"06/28/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/03/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/05/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/10/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/12/2023 ","avail":"low-availability"},{"date":"07/17/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/19/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/24/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/26/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"07/31/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/07/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/09/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/14/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/16/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/23/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"08/30/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/06/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/13/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/20/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"09/27/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"},{"date":"10/02/2023 ","avail":"unavailable"}],"videos":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRhQ1OzeS8A","https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dNpVU8CouE"],"reviews":[{"id":"363469","rating":"1","author":"Corinna ","date":"2020-05-23T16:44:07-05:00","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered 22 chicks (20 females, 2 males)on 03/07/20 and received 30 on 03/17.
